*** Day 3 ***

Push - Pull - Clone - gitignore - Conflict

1- We first create a new Repository on GitHub
2- It will give a https link
3- When we first want push from our local to the GitHub, we go to our folder on our computer.
4- Open the terminal/local
5- See the status/versions/master-branch updated?
6- When we want to send this to GitHub, we take the link of our new Repository from the GitHub (no2)
7- We follow the codes from GitHub list (when we are setting it for the new Repository) On terminal; 
	step1 = git remote add origin (and the link from the GitHub) -> enter
	step2 = git push -u origin master(Note1: or main what ever my master is called) (Note2: or if I only write "git push" and enter, git will tell me what to write. Copy/paste that one -> enter

After we connected to the GitHub,we only have two commands to use;
	git commit -am"message"
	git push ->When we write smth new to our local and we want to push it to GitHub

If I want to send it to another Repository;

* I go to the Repository, click on code, copy the https link, come back to the terminal and command; git push (and the link)
