*******Stashing



Git stash saves the uncommitted changes locally, allowing you to make changes, switch branches, and perform other Git operations. You can then reapply the stashed changes when you need them. A stash is locally scoped and is not pushed to the remote by git push.

git stash -> saves the docs in working space and staging area temporarily and cleans up these areas.

git stash list -> views the changes in the temporary memory.

git stash pop -> gets your stashed changes back
