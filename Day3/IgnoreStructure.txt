*** Day 3 ***

Push - Pull - Clone - GITIGNORE - Conflict

If there is some information I shouldn't share with other colleagues, I can use the gitignore to hide that information.

I can also use this ignore, for the files I dont want to send to the staging area.

1- In my local, I open a file and name it gitignore for Mac (.gitignore in windows)
2- The file I want to hide, I take the full name with its extension and put/save that in the ignore file I created
3- I can add more than files in this area
4-
